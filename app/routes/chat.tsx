        I consider myself incredibly fortunate to be involved in the open-source
        community, creating tools and resources that others find beneficial. I
        enjoy a lot doing open source, working and learning together with the
        fantastic community. I realize that many of you, like myself, are
        enthusiastic about contributing to open source projects but may be
        unsure where to begin. That I actually also struggled with along the
        way.
